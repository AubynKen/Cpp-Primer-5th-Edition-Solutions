The code is not legal.

The following code fragment:

```c++
<< " and " << v2;
```

does not form a statement on its own without ```std::cout```. Thus the code doesn't compile.

One possible fix would be the following:

```c++
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1; 
std::cout << " and " << v2; 
std::cout << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```
