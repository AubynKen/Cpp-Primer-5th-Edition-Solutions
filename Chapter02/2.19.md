## Reference

A **reference** must be initialized upon declaration. Its is not an object and its value cannot be changed. Once a
reference is defined, we cannot change the object that it references.

The syntax of initializing a reference goes as the following:

```c++
int x = 42;
int &ref_x = x; // ref_x references the variable x
```

## Pointer

A **pointer** is a variable. It is mainly used for containing the memory address of a variable (for other uses, cf. the
book). Its value can be changed.

Using a pointer:

```c++
int x = 42, y = -1;
int *ptr_x = &x; // ptr_x points to x
ptr_x = &y; // we can change the value of a pointer
```
